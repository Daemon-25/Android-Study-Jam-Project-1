Event Management

__Problem Statement__:

Considering the current situation, The trend is to do all the work virtually, and every user wants their work and needs at their fingertips. Many challenges arise when we think of buying tickets or seats for an event. We just start imagining long queues, and keeping in mind the growing pandemic. The decision to create an online event booking mobile application can prove to be quite right and very beneficial for society.

__Proposed Solution__:

The Project named "myEvents" offers an "Event Booking System" to enable hassle-free event booking, in which users can simply reserve their seats based on their needs. This is beneficial because it reduces waiting time and promotes social distancing for health-related reasons. When the user opens the App, he can see there is a list of various events; as the user book the seat of any event, the required information is saved in our database for further verification purposes. It also proved helpful to save precious time. The Project's goal is to collaborate with other institutions and companies to expand it to include event booking services in the future.

__Functionality & Concepts used__:

__•__	The App has a very simple and interactive interface that helps the users participate in the events as per their interest. Following are a few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in App:

__•__	Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the App uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

__•__	Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for users to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also use the Navigation library to switch between different screens.

__•__	RecyclerView: We used the efficient recycler view to present the list of different events. 

__•__	LiveData, ViewModels, Room Database: We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the booking of events to change the number of seats accordingly. Seats are then updated accordingly.

__•__	Navigation Drawer: We used a navigation drawer for smooth navigation between screens like App and profile segments. We also added share and contact options to share app links and provide us feedback.

__Application Link & Future Scope__:

The App is currently in the testing phase with a limited no. of users, You can access the App: .apk link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18tJ-kiQ27ShpoYPATbH_1_XOD9aUbcXD/view?usp=sharing

After the mobile application is fully tested and upgraded with a newer version, we plan to collaborate with universities and companies and also want to add some special features like where users can see events that will be happening nearby. They can suggest the events which could be organized in the future, and the user will be able to check the live location of the events through the map; for faster checkout, they can store credit or debit cards and add upcoming events to your calendar.
